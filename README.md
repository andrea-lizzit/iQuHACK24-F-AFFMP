Our goal was to find the optimized unitaries to implement the gates CZ and CCZ.
We did it in the correspondent jupyter notebooks, where we used the procedure expalined in the papers. We found the matrix of permanents A and with that we calculated the Fidelity and Success probability and we maximized them (more detailes are written in the notebooks).
Then we used the numerical Unitary matrix obtained to find a linear optical circuit, using a circuit optimizer notebook in Parceval.
